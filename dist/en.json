HN's main mission is to promote emerging young art produced in Spain through monthly installations, live installation residencies, sound residencies and digital residencies within our own Metaverse. The space has a large window to the outside, which allows each installation and project to be visible from the outside.",
        "contenido-p1": "HN was born from the idea of ​​recreating the most intimate and private place for each artist, their own room. It is where each one shapes their dreams. Here, these dreams do not escape into the sky, but rather fall to earth and materialize. This is where all the installations that are presented month by month are born.",
        "contenido-p2": "One of the main goals of HN34 is to prevail as a reference in the cultural sector in terms of artistic development. Create new integrations with emerging art and confront what has already been learned in the sector. Being in constant evolution.",
        "contenido-p3": "From HN34 we propose that art should be public and free. For this reason, we offer visibility to emerging artists, who have greater difficulties to be positioned in the market. HN34 proposes a new way of relating to art, moving away from the conventional industry. We want to mobilize these projects to accessible and free spaces, interact with different audiences and provoke new models of exchange through art."
